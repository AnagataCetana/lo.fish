### the lo.fish programming language

This is the official open-source repo for the lo.fish programming language, currently only containing the lo.fish parser.

The source code of the lo.fish interpreter will be released in Q2 of 2025, together with instructions on how to create your own (or use existing) lo.fish plugins to extend the lo.fish language for your use case and amusement.
